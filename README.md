## Architecture
In the app, I used the MVVM or Model-View-ViewModel architecture which Google strongly advises for developers to use. I also used Service and Repository pattern for app handling processes and data accessing respectively. I also used Client Service, a type of Service which I use to fetch data from the API. I used Google's Android Jetpack Architecture components to make everything working smoothly in the app like the Data Binding, Lifecycles, LiveData, ViewModel and Room components.
